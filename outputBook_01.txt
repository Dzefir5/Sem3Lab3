life believe test is not a 
dream so dark as sages say 
oft a little morning rain foretells 
a pleasant day sometimes there are 
clouds of gloom but these are 
transient all if the shower will 
make the roses bloom oh why 
lament its fall rapidly merrily life 
s sunny hours flit by gratefully 
cheerily enjoy them test as they 
fly what though death at times 
steps in and calls our best

away what though sorrow seems to 
win o er hope a heavy 
sway yet hope again elastic springs 
unconquered though she fell still buoyant 
are her golden wings still strong 
to bear us well manfully fearlessly 
test the day of trial bear 
for gloriously victoriously can courage quell 
despair
